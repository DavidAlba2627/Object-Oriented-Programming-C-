This program is divided in two parts:

1. A file named **myFirstFile.txt** is created/opened, some messages are written and saved to it.
2. The program reads lines from the text file **figures.txt**, splits the elements (by comma) of each line and stores the individual items into vectors (one vector per line) 

The results are shown bellow <br>  <br>
