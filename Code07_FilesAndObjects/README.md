# Description
This program calculates the Area and Perimeter of different types of figures, reading the kind of figure and its cartesian plane coordinates from the file **FiguresParameters.txt**. Each line contains: A letter that represent the figure (**T** for triangle, **R** for rectangle and **C for circle**), then the coordinates for the figure are written separated by commas. For example:

1. **T,-2,1,2,1,0,5** : It represents a triangle with vertices at the coordinates (-2,1), (2,1) and (0,5)
2. **R,3,4,3,6,5,4,5,6** : It represents a rectangle with vertices at the coordinates (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6)
3. **C,0,1,3** : It represents a circle with center at the coordinate (0,1) and has a radius of 3

The results are shown bellow <br>  <br>
