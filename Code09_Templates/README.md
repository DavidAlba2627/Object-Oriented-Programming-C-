This program shows the utility of using templates as function parameters. The following functions were defined:

1. **swapping** : This function swaps the values of two variables with each other.
2. **printArray** : This function print all the elements of an array on one line.
3. **bubbleSort** : This function implements the bubble sort algorithm on an array.

These functions were used indiscriminately with variables and arrays of type int, float, char and strings. <br> 

The results for the **swapping** function are: <br>  <br>
