# Description
This program creates a base class named **Person**, with the attributes of *Age*, *Name* and *Address*. A derived class, defined as **Student**, is created too, which adds the attributes of *NUA* (id of student), *Semester* and *GradeAverage*.
In the *main* script, the program performs the following steps:

1. Two people, David (33 years old, lives in California) and John (43 years old, lives in Texas) are created.
2. The people are stored into a vector and, using a loop, some parameters of them are modified. 
3. An student, Richard (19 years old, lives in New York, his NUA is 12345, 2Â° semester, grade average of 9.3)
